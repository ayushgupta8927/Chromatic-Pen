#Conversion of Black and white images to colored images using OpenCV and pretrained caffe model
 for viewing the project and using it :
 1) Download the zip file and extract it
 2) run the application(exe file) inside the unzipped folder and you are set to go
 
 The Application uses Python flask as backend and HTML, CSS, Jquery as a front-end
 
 
 Image colorization is the process of taking an input grayscale (black and white) image and then producing an output colorized image
 that represents the semantic colors and tones of the input (for example, 
 an ocean on a clear sunny day must be plausibly “blue” —it can’t be colored “hot pink” by the model).
 
 For Colorization of Black and white image it uses OpenCV and Deep learning Texhniques
